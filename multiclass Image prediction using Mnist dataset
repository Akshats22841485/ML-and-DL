Created a Deep Learning model using ANN to identify the one digit number in the given image dataset
The dataset used is MNIST dataset.
The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset used for training and testing in the field of machine learning for handwritten digit recognition. 
The MINST dataset stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology". 
The dataset contains a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 
The dataset was created by re-mixing samples from NIST's original datasets, which were taken from American Census Bureau employees and high school students. 
It is designed to help scientists develop and test machine learning algorithms in pattern recognition and machine learning. 
It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.
